# Unmail

Like unzipping, but for MBOX files!

This is an early implementation of Unmail, an MBOX attachment extractor.
The idea is to rewrite this thing in Rust as a backend crate and
implement an UI per platform.

I'll be moving this over soon [to Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/xerz/unmail),
please go over there to check out the latest info!

BTW the project is licensed as MIT, in case you wonder.
